## check-opencloud-security 1.8.0

### Added

- **A remediation planner**, answering "what gets you to A+" rather than only
  "what is wrong". The rating already records which finding held it down and
  by how much, so replaying that arithmetic with one finding removed at a time
  gives an ordered fix list with the grade each step would reach - including
  the update step, because fixing findings can never lift a rating above what
  the installed version allows. It is derived from the result document and
  stored nowhere new. New module `opencloud_local_scan/remediation.py`, a
  `remediationPlan` key in every scan result, a section on the dashboard, the
  plan in the CSV, SARIF and PDF exports, a `--debug` block in the plugin, a
  `planRemediation` Arazzo workflow and a `plan_remediation` MCP tool.
- ADR 0012 records why the plan is derived from the rating rather than
  modelled beside it, and why it is stored nowhere.
- Remediation text for every finding the extra-check pass can report -
  `tlsTrusted`, `directoryListing`, `maintenanceMode`, the `exposed:`,
  `authentication:`, `debugEndpoint:`, `debugPort:` and `versionDisclosure:`
  families and the rest. Until now `describe_hardening()` explained the
  hardening flags and the headers but answered "No description is available"
  for exactly the checks that cap a rating, which left the one part of a
  report an operator has to act on as the one part that said nothing.
- A Model Context Protocol endpoint at `POST /mcp`, so an AI agent can run the
  same checks a browser can. Six tools, one per user-level task -
  `scan_instance`, `scan_instances`, `get_scan_result`, `plan_remediation`,
  `export_scan` and `erase_instance_data` - and three resources exposing the
  OpenAPI, Arazzo and discovery documents. The tools call this application's own HTTP API in
  process, so an agent meets exactly the same SSRF guard, rate limits and
  purge authorisation; `erase_instance_data` is marked destructive and takes
  its credential from the request headers, never from a tool argument. Needs
  the new optional `mcp` extra, and is off when it is not installed. See
  [ADR 0011](adr/0011-mcp-is-an-execution-layer-not-a-second-implementation.md).
- `GET /.well-known/ai.json`, a discovery document naming the OpenAPI schema,
  the Arazzo workflows, the MCP endpoint, the usage limits worth respecting
  and the link to self-hosting. It is an application-level convention rather
  than a registered standard, and it exists so that an agent starting from
  nothing but the origin needs one request to find everything else.
- `webapp/workflows.py`, the single place the workflow semantics live: the
  poll interval and attempt ceiling, the submit retry count, which statuses
  are terminal, and the prose explaining each of them. The Arazzo document is
  rendered from it and the MCP tools execute it, so the described behaviour
  and the executed behaviour are the same code.
- Discovery hints in the head of every page - `rel="service-desc"`,
  `rel="arazzo"` and `rel="ai-discovery"` - and a **For AI agents** section on
  `/api` linking the same four addresses as ordinary clickable links.
- `COS_WEB_ENABLE_MCP` (default `true`) and `COS_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for
  the `Host` values the MCP endpoint accepts.
- `GET /sitemap.xml` and `GET /robots.txt` in the web application, both
  generated rather than kept as files. The sitemap lists the landing page and
  the four explanations, and takes each `lastmod` from the template that
  renders the page, so it cannot drift from the routes that exist. Neither
  mentions a result: `robots.txt` disallows `/scan/`, `/api/`, `/mcp` and the
  health probe, while explicitly allowing the machine-readable documents.
- `COS_WEB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` sets the origin used in the canonical links and
  the sitemap. Behind a proxy the service only sees its own internal address
  and would otherwise publish URLs nobody outside can reach.
- `COS_WEB_ALLOW_INDEXING` (default `true`) decides whether search engines may
  index the five public pages. Turning it off restores the previous behaviour
  in full: a flat `robots.txt`, a 404 for the sitemap and `noindex` everywhere.
- Every page now carries a canonical URL, platform-neutral OpenGraph metadata
  and a title that names the service. See
  [ADR 0009](adr/0009-public-pages-indexable-results-never.md).

- **Transport security is now inspected in detail**, in a new module
  `opencloud_local_scan/tls.py`. The check used to end at "the handshake
  worked, the certificate is trusted, it expires on this date"; it now also
  reports the negotiated protocol and cipher, whether the server still accepts
  a deprecated one, whether the certificate actually covers the name it was
  asked for, whether the chain it presents is complete, whether its lifetime
  stays inside the 398 days browsers accept, and whether an OCSP response is
  stapled to the handshake. Five new findings - `tlsDeprecatedProtocol`,
  `tlsHostname`, `tlsChain`, `tlsCertificateLifetime` and `tlsOcspStapling` -
  are explained in the hardening catalogue like every other one.
- A `tls` block in the result document carries the measurements behind those
  findings: the protocol and cipher, the certificate's subject, issuer,
  validity window and remaining days, its names, the chain length, and what
  the deprecated-protocol and stapling probes found. It is on the dashboard as
  a **Transport security** card, in the JSON, CSV, SARIF and PDF exports, in
  the `TlsDetail` schema in `/openapi.json` and in the MCP result view.
  **A measurement that could not be taken is absent, never a pass**: `null`
  means "not determined", so a check the platform or the server made
  impossible is left out rather than quietly counted in the instance's favour.
  See [ADR 0013](adr/0013-transport-security-is-measured-not-assumed.md).

### Changed

- `/openapi.json` and `/arazzo.json` are now always public, at stable paths
  and without authentication. `COS_WEB_ENABLE_DOCS` governs only the browsable
  `/docs` and `/redoc` pages, which is what it was really protecting: those
  relax the content policy to render, while a JSON document does not. A
  description nobody can fetch describes nothing. See
  [ADR 0010](adr/0010-machine-readable-descriptions-are-always-public.md).
- The OpenAPI document is now written rather than inferred, and describes the
  API as it actually behaves. The generated one declared a form body where
  scan creation takes JSON, `200` where it answers `202 Accepted`, and empty
  schemas where a client needed the shape of a result. Every response now has
  a named schema mirroring the implementation field for field - the uuid a
  caller needs, the scan record with its state, `done`, summary and available
  exports, the batch's accepted and rejected lists, the purge receipt and the
  health body - and every description says what an agent should do with a
  status: `409` on an export means *not yet*, `404` means *never*.
- The Arazzo workflows now describe the real lifecycle. `awaitScanResult` is a
  new shared workflow that polls until `done`, stops immediately on a 404
  because an unknown or expired uuid never becomes known, and gives up after a
  bounded number of attempts. `scanManyInstances` no longer passes batch uuids
  into a workflow expecting a `target_url`; it waits on the accepted uuids and
  does not retry a target the backend rejected. `eraseInstanceData` documents
  the authorisation, the receipt, the counts and the signature.
- The header navigation collapses behind a menu button on narrow screens. Six
  links and the brand line did not fit across a phone, so the last entries
  could only be reached by scrolling the page sideways. The collapsed layout
  is switched on by `nav.js` itself, so with scripting blocked the links stay
  on the page and wrap onto a second row.
- `scripts/check_documentation_links.py` no longer trusts a status code on
  `docs.opencloud.eu`. It is a single-page application, so an address that no
  longer exists answers `200` with the application shell and only renders
  "Page not found" once a browser gets to it - which is why three dead links
  sat in the catalogue with the checker reporting everything healthy. A
  `/docs/` address is now checked against the site's own `sitemap.xml` as
  well. The checker also imports the hardening catalogue instead of only
  reading source text, because a URL long enough to be split across two string
  literals is invisible to a regular expression, and those are the longest
  links this project documents.
- The landing page, the form, the progress track and the result dashboard now
  hold their shape below 640px: full-width buttons, a smaller dial, a stacked
  footer and no element wider than the viewport.
- The landing page and the four explanations are now indexable; a result page
  is not, and never can be. It carries `noindex` in the markup and an
  `X-Robots-Tag` on the response, as does every export and API reply.

### Fixed

- An untrusted certificate no longer hides its own expiry date. `getpeercert()`
  returns nothing at all when verification is off, so on an instance with a
  self-signed certificate - the default OpenCloud ships - the certificate
  expiry check produced no finding whatsoever, and an expired certificate went
  unreported on exactly the instances most likely to have one. The certificate
  is now decoded from the presented chain regardless of whether it verified.
- A server offering only TLS 1.0 is reported as speaking an obsolete protocol
  rather than as unreachable. Python's client refuses such a handshake outright,
  which read as "no TLS here" instead of the finding it should have been.
- Three documentation links pointed at pages that no longer exist: the update
  guide, the external identity provider reference and the reverse proxy setup.
  All three are reachable again, in the hardening catalogue and in the README.

### Security

- The MCP tools no longer hand a scanned host a channel to the model. A
  version string, a product name, an explanation and an error message are all
  chosen by somebody else's server, and they land in a language model's
  context: each is now collapsed, stripped of non-printable characters and
  truncated, a version that does not parse becomes `unparsable`, and the
  answer carries an `untrusted` block naming those fields and stating that
  they are to be reported and never obeyed. The same warning is in the server
  instructions and the tool descriptions.
- A `uuid` given to an MCP tool is validated as a UUID before it reaches a
  request path. An HTTP client resolves `..` in a path, so `../../healthz`
  previously addressed the application rather than a scan; an identifier that
  does not parse now gets the same 404 unknown and expired do, without a
  request being made. The purge target is percent-encoded for the same reason,
  so a `&` in it can no longer add a second query parameter.
- Every MCP tool call is now rate limited against the address it actually came
  from. The in-process transport reported a hardcoded `127.0.0.1`, so in the
  default configuration every agent in the world shared one bucket and one
  audit identity - rationing strangers by each other, and letting one busy
  client lock the rest out.
- `COS_WEB_MCP_MAX_CONCURRENT_WAITS` (default `8`) caps how many tool calls
  may sit waiting on a scan at once, so a handful of calls cannot pin the
  process open for the minutes a scan may take. Nothing is refused when the
  ceiling is reached: the scan is submitted as usual and the uuid comes back
  with a note to poll `get_scan_result`, exactly as `wait: false` answers.

### Documentation

- Every page now says in its footer that this check is **not exhaustive and a
  good grade is not a certificate**: it reads what a publicly reachable
  instance shows an anonymous visitor, so an "A" means nothing checked went
  wrong, not that the instance is secure. A result page repeats it next to the
  grade and links to a fuller "what this scan cannot see", which now names the
  categories an unauthenticated scan cannot reach at all - the host and its
  packages, the container runtime, the proxy's own configuration, backups,
  storage, secrets, accounts and sign-in, existing shares, the supply chain,
  and anything only a logged-in user sees. `tests/test_webapp_api.py` fails if
  a page loses the caveat.
- [`docs/reverse-proxy.md`](docs/reverse-proxy.md), a guide to reverse proxies
  in both directions: the header set this check grades, written out for nginx,
  Apache httpd, Caddy, Traefik and HAProxy, together with the mistakes that
  cost an instance a grade; and what the scan service needs from a proxy - a
  client address it can rate limit, timeouts longer than a scan, an unbuffered
  `/mcp` event stream, and the discovery paths left unrewritten. Linked from
  the README guide table, the docs index, `docs/webapp.md` and
  `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` gains **The agent-facing surfaces**, which was missing
  entirely: how `webapp/workflows.py` holds the semantics once and
  `/openapi.json`, `/arazzo.json` and `/mcp` are three descriptions of it, how
  `/.well-known/ai.json` leads to all three, and what the MCP endpoint may not
  do - be a second implementation, a way around a rate limit, a channel from a
  scanned host to the model, or a place a credential lives. Its module tables
  now name `tls.py`, `remediation.py` and the seven web modules added since
  they were written. `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` gain
  the same rules in short, so an agent working on a tool has them without
  reading the code.
- `AGENTS.md` gains a **Third parties** section, and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `frontend/README.md` the same rule in
  short: nothing in this project may connect to Twitter/X, Google or Meta -
  no script, font, embed, SDK, analytics, CAPTCHA, sign-in or share button,
  and no metadata addressed to one of them. A visitor hands this service the
  address of a system they are responsible for, and a result URL's uuid is the
  whole of its authorisation; neither belongs in a third party's logs. Plain
  links and platform-neutral OpenGraph tags stay, because nothing fetches
  them, and `tests/test_webapp_seo.py` fails if a page starts carrying such
  metadata.
