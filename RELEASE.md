## check-opencloud-security 1.2.0

### Added

- **`--baseline PATH` and `--warn-on-new`**, for operators who do not want the
  full state of every instance on every run. The baseline records the findings
  of each run, one entry per host, and `--warn-on-new` then reports `OK` while
  the picture is unchanged and the normal status as soon as anything is new or
  worse. The evidence is never suppressed - only the alert - and three things
  always escalate: a new finding, a lower rating, and a release past its end of
  life, which receives no security fixes and therefore cannot be grandfathered
  in. The first run has nothing to compare against, so it reports normally and
  becomes the baseline; `--warn-on-new` without `--baseline` is rejected rather
  than quietly reporting "nothing new" forever; and a baseline that cannot be
  written is a line of output, never a change of verdict. See
  [Reporting only what changed](README.md#reporting-only-what-changed).
- **`--self-update-check`**, which asks PyPI once a day whether a newer version
  of the plugin has been published and appends a note. Off by default, cached
  under `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/check-opencloud-security/`, silent on
  every failure, and it never changes the exit code - whether PyPI answered
  says nothing about the instance being monitored.
- **`--upgrade-self --check-only`** as a second spelling of
  `--upgrade-self check`, because that is the pairing people reach for first.
  Used without `--upgrade-self` it is rejected with a usage error instead of
  being silently ignored.
- **Shell completion** via [argcomplete](https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete)
  for both `check-opencloud-security` and `check-opencloud-scanner`. It
  completes option names, the values of the options that take a fixed set, and
  the hardening identifiers of `--ignore-hardening`, which are long enough to
  be worth not typing. Install it with the new `completion` extra
  (`pipx install 'check-opencloud-security[completion]'`); without it nothing
  is registered and the plugin behaves as before. See
  [Shell completion](README.md#shell-completion).
- **A `HEALTHCHECK` in the Dockerfile** that verifies the image rather than an
  instance: the package imports and the two data files it rates against - the
  release schedule and the bundled advisory database - parse. It needs no
  network, so it stays honest on an air-gapped host. Containers running the
  scan service keep using the HTTP `/healthz` probe that `docker-compose.yml`
  already overrides it with.
- **An SBOM and Sigstore build attestations** for every release. The publish
  workflow generates a CycloneDX SBOM from the resolved runtime environment,
  attaches it to the GitHub release, and signs provenance for the wheel and
  sdist with a short-lived Sigstore certificate - so there is no signing key
  for this project to leak. Verify a downloaded artifact with
  `gh attestation verify <file> --repo sowoi/check-opencloud-security`.
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**, so GitHub Copilot picks up the same
  rules `AGENTS.md` already states - the layer boundary between the plugin and
  the scanner library, how a setting travels from the file to
  `ScannerSettings`, and the conventions that are invisible in any single file.
- **A [`docs/`](docs/README.md) folder**, with the deployment walk-throughs
  that were crowding the README - [Icinga Director](docs/icinga-director.md),
  [Ansible](docs/ansible.md), [scheduling](docs/scheduling.md) and
  [troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) - and worked examples for the
  places this check tends to end up: [Kubernetes](docs/kubernetes.md),
  [CI pipelines](docs/ci.md), [Prometheus and Grafana](docs/prometheus.md),
  [webhook adapters](docs/webhook-recipes.md) for Slack, ntfy and
  Alertmanager, and [fleets of instances](docs/many-instances.md). The README
  keeps a guide table and links into each of them.

### Changed

- **`--configure` now edits the configuration instead of starting from
  scratch.** The file already on disk is loaded and every stored value is
  offered as the default for its question, so Enter keeps it and only what
  needs changing has to be typed; `-` removes a configured value, and keys the
  wizard has no question for survive untouched instead of being silently
  dropped. Before saving it offers a test scan of the host with the answers
  just given, and diagnoses the usual failures (certificate, unreachable, not
  an OpenCloud) rather than only reporting them. A failing scan does not block
  saving - the file may well be written somewhere that cannot reach the
  instance. `check-opencloud-scanner configure --no-test-scan` skips the offer.

- **`--dry-run` is gone; use `--upgrade-self=check` instead.** The flag only
  ever meant anything together with `--upgrade-self`, and on its own it was
  accepted and silently ignored - a dangerous thing for a flag whose whole
  promise is "this changes nothing". `--upgrade-self` now takes an optional
  value, `run` (the default when given without one) or `check`, and a bare
  `--dry-run` is rejected rather than obeyed halfway.
